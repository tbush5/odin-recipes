    <h2>Yummy fun Halloween Treat</h2>
    <p>
      This is a fun Halloween sweet treat that is easy enough for kids to help
      make. Keeping the chocolate candy chilled makes it easier to slice in
      half. The centers are on the soft side and will bend or crack if too warm.
    </p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>½ cup shortening</li>
      <li>½ cup peanut butter</li>
      <li>½ cup packed brown sugar</li>
      <li>½ cup white sugar</li>
      <li>1 egg, beaten</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons milk</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
      <li>1 ¾ cups all-purpose flour</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon baking soda</li>
      <li>½ teaspoon salt</li>
      <li>¼ cup white sugar for rolling</li>
      <li>
        24 chocolate candy spheres with smooth chocolate filling (such as Lindt
        Lindor Truffles), refrigerated until cold
      </li>
      <li>48 decorative candy eyeballs</li>
      <li>½ cup prepared chocolate frosting</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Line baking sheets with
        baking parchment.
      </li>
      <li>
        Beat shortening, peanut butter, brown sugar, and 1/2 cup white sugar
        together with an electric mixer in a large bowl until smooth. Beat egg
        into the creamy mixture until fully incorporated. Stir milk and vanilla
        extract into the mixture until smooth.
      </li>
      <li>
        Mix flour, baking soda, and salt together in a small bowl; add to the
        wet mixture in the large bowl and stir until completely incorporated
        into a dough. Divide and shape dough into 48 balls.
      </li>
      <li>
        Spread 1/4 cup white sugar into a wide, shallow bowl. Roll dough balls
        in sugar to coat and arrange about 2 inches apart onto prepared baking
        sheets.
      </li>
      <li>
        Bake in preheated oven until golden brown, 10 to 12 minutes. Remove
        cookies from oven and quickly press a dimple into the middle of each
        cookie using the blunt end of a wooden spoon. Cool cookies on sheets for
        10 minutes before transferring to a wire cooling rack to cool
        completely.
      </li>
      <li>
        Cut each chocolate sphere into two hemispheres. Put one piece atop each
        cookie with the rounded side facing upwards.
      </li>
      <li>
        Spoon frosting into a pastry bag with a small round tip or a plastic
        freezer bag with one end snipped off. Dab a small amount of frosting
        onto the back of each candy eyeball and stick two onto each chocolate
        candy to resemble eyes. Then pipe frosting in four thin lines, starting
        at the base of the candy, on each side atop the cookie to resemble
        spider legs.
      </li>
      <li>
        Let frosting harden at room temperature, about 30 minutes. Store cookies
        in an airtight container.
      </li>
